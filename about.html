        <p>The Manhattan Institute for Policy Research is a leading free-market think tank whose mission is to develop and disseminate new ideas that foster greater economic choice and individual responsibility. Founded in 1977 by Antony Fisher and William J. Casey, the Institute has been at the forefront of America's most important policy debates for over four decades.</p>

        <p>Our scholars and fellows produce rigorous, evidence-based research on the most pressing issues facing America's cities, states, and the nation. From urban policy and economic regulation to education reform and public safety, the Manhattan Institute works to turn bold ideas into meaningful policy change.</p>

        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>The Manhattan Institute's mission is to advance opportunity, individual liberty, and the rule of law in America and its great cities. We pursue this mission through research, publishing, and civic engagement, bringing together scholars, policymakers, journalists, and civic leaders to build a more prosperous, free, and just society.</p>

        <p>We believe that free markets, personal responsibility, and the institutions of civil society are essential to human flourishing. Our work spans eight core policy areas: Cities, Culture, Economics, Education, Governance, Health, Public Safety, and Technology.</p>

        <h2>Our Values</h2>
        <p>The Manhattan Institute is guided by a set of core principles that have remained constant since our founding:</p>

        <p><strong>Intellectual Rigor:</strong> We hold ourselves to the highest standards of evidence-based research. Our scholars produce work that is methodologically sound, clearly reasoned, and grounded in real-world data.</p>

        <p><strong>Independence:</strong> We are a nonpartisan organization committed to following the evidence wherever it leads. Our scholars represent diverse perspectives united by a commitment to free markets and individual liberty.</p>

        <p><strong>Impact:</strong> We measure our success not by the volume of our output but by the real-world impact of our ideas. From welfare reform to broken-windows policing to school choice, MI ideas have shaped American life.</p>

        <p><strong>Boldness:</strong> We are not afraid to challenge conventional wisdom, question sacred cows, or propose solutions that are creative and unconventional. Our tagline says it all: Creative. Bold. Independent.</p>
